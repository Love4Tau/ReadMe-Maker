  # ReadMe-Maker

  

  ## Description
  This command-line application takes user input and generates a README.md file. This README.md generator will make my life alot easier. I can never remember every section/thing I need to add to my readme file so I always have to spend an extra minute or two searching for the readme guidelines. This should save developers a few minutes of their time. Creating the questions array was my favorite part of this project. Figuring out how I wanted to create the license functions in my markdown file was a slight headache. I decided to map my badges and links to objects and use that the render the badges/links. I also had to refer back to the cloud recordings for a refresher on inquirer.

  ## Installation
  1. Open cloned repo in a code editor.
  2. Open integrate terminal in code editor. 
  3. Run this command "node index.js" without the quotes 
  4. Answer the prompts in the CLI 
  5. Your README file should be created after answering all the prompts!

  ## Usage
  This CLI app is very useful for bootcamp students who are getting familiar with creating readme files for their projects. Users who are new will have trouble remembering every section that will need to be included in their README file, so this will help those individuals save time.
